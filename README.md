# Unity 3D Galton Board

This is my first attempt at Unity and C#. Tried to do something relatively simple just to get my feet wet.

## What is a Galton Board?

The Galton board, also known as the Galton box or quincunx or bean machine, is a device invented by Sir Francis Galton to demonstrate the central limit theorem, in particular that with sufficient sample size the binomial distribution approximates a normal distribution. Among its applications, it afforded insight into regression to the mean or "reversion to mediocrity".
